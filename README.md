## Description

QuakeEye is a data visualization project that displays real-time earthquake data from the USGS API using an interactive map. The project is designed to provide users with an easy-to-use interface for exploring earthquake data on a global scale.

## Info

This project was developed in the wake of the recent unfortunate events of the earthquakes that hit Türkiye and Suyria during the month of February 2023, therefore the map is zoomed on the region of Türkiye and Suyria common border.

You can zoom-out for a global view of earthquakes around the globe.
